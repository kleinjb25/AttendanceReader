# AttendanceReader
 Make taking attendance easier in your club with this bot! By typing a simple command, the bot will append your uniqueid (or whatever term your university name uses) to a university domain name, making gathering names easier! Also, for admins (which can be changed with $changeAdmin), they can type $helpAdmin to list admin-related commands.
